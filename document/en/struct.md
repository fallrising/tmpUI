# Quick Start
I'm sure it will be easier than you can imagine.

## Project structure
tmpUI can help you implement include and require in PHP (or similar backend languages) in template mode.  
Just use the common project structure we used to have. For example, a structure like this.

* ./tmpui.js
* ./tmpui.checker.js
* ./index.html
* ./favicon.ico

* ./tpl/*.html
* ./lang/*.json

* ./assets/*.css
* ./assets/*.js

* ./plugin/*/*.js
* ./plugin/*/*.css
* ./plugin/*/*.html

## Wrap-up

Simple enough, isn't it? Everything is in order, and it still has that familiar flavor.  
tmpUI.js is the engine of tmpUI, index.html is the application entry file.  
The tpl is generally used to store page templates, assets to store css and js used in the project, lang to store language files, and plugin to store third-party plugins.  
Of course, you can also organize your project any way you like.
